title: sortPackages
---

When using the `format` command, enables sorting the root properties of `package.json` in alphabetical order.

This pairs well with the [`sortFirst`](/syncpack/config/sort-first) option, allowing you to ensure that eg. the `name` and `version` properties are always at the top of the file, with the other properties following in A-Z order.

## Default Value

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "sortPackages": true
}
```

:::note

There is no equivalent CLI Option for this configuration.
