A list of [Glob](HREF_GLOB) patterns to find package.json files you want to manage with syncpack.

<MonorepoNotEssentialTip />

## Example

In this example we have a directory on our machine called `my-projects` where we `git clone` all of the repositories we work on for our company.

Despite us not having a monorepo, a .syncpackrc.json placed alongside each `git clone` allows us to use syncpack to find and fix problems.

```json title="~/my-projects/.syncpackrc.json"
{
  "source": ["./*/package.json", "./*/packages/*/package.json"]
}
```
