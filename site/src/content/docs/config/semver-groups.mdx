Allow some packages to have different semver range rules to the rest of your monorepo. Each dependency can only belong to one semver group, the first rule which matches a given dependency and package will apply.

## Examples

1: Every dependency of `@myrepo/library` should have a semver range of `~`, regardless of what the rest of the monorepo uses:

```json title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "packages": ["@myrepo/library"],
      "range": "~"
    }
  ]
}
```

2: Every dependency of `@myrepo/library` whose name matches `@alpha/**` should have a semver range of `^`, regardless of what the rest of that package or the rest of the monorepo uses:

```json title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["@alpha/**"],
      "packages": ["@myrepo/library"],
      "range": "^"
    }
  ]
}
```

3: Every dependency in the monorepo whose name matches `@alpha/**` should have a semver range of `~`, regardless of what the rest of the monorepo uses:

```json title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["@alpha/**"],
      "range": "~"
    }
  ]
}
```

4: Production dependencies should have fixed version numbers, but development and peer dependencies can be broader.

```json title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "dependencyTypes": [
        "prod",
        "resolutions",
        "overrides",
        "pnpmOverrides",
        "local"
      ],
      "range": ""
    },
    {
      "dependencyTypes": ["dev"],
      "range": "~"
    },
    {
      "dependencyTypes": ["peer"],
      "range": "^"
    }
  ]
}
```
