import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import Packages from "@partials/group-config/packages.mdx";
import Dependencies from "@partials/group-config/dependencies.mdx";
import DependencyTypes from "@partials/group-config/dependency-types.mdx";
import SpecifierTypes from "@partials/group-config/specifier-types.mdx";
import Label from "@partials/group-config/label.mdx";

Allow many dependencies to be interpreted as one.

## Example

Treat all dependencies from the [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/) as if they were all instances of a single dependency called `aws-sdk-dependencies`.

```jsonc title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "dependencyGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["@aws-sdk/**"],
      "aliasName": "aws-sdk-dependencies",
    },
  ],
}
```

With the above config: "@aws-sdk/core", "@aws-sdk/middleware-logger" etc will be treated as if they were one dependency â€“ any differences in their versions will be caught in the usual way.

## Configuration

### aliasName <Badge text="Required" variant="danger" />

The name to use in place of the originals when referring to this group of merged dependencies.

When assigning this new dependency to version/semver groups etc, use the **aliasName** instead of the original name.

### dependencies <Badge text="Optional" variant="note" />

<Dependencies />

### dependencyTypes <Badge text="Optional" variant="note" />

<DependencyTypes />

### specifierTypes <Badge text="Optional" variant="note" />

<SpecifierTypes />

### label <Badge text="Optional" variant="note" />

<Label />

### packages <Badge text="Optional" variant="note" />
