title: Semver Groups
---

This is an addendum to the [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started) guide.

Allow some packages to have different semver range rules to the rest of your monorepo. Each dependency can only belong to one semver group, the first rule which matches a given dependency and package will apply.

## Examples

1: Every dependency of `@myrepo/library` should have a semver range of `~`, regardless of what the rest of the monorepo uses:

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "range": "~",
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["@myrepo/library"]
    }
  ]
}
```

2: Every dependency of `@myrepo/library` whose name matches `@alpha/**` should have a semver range of `^`, regardless of what the rest of that package or the rest of the monorepo uses:

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "range": "^",
      "dependencies": ["@alpha/**"],
      "packages": ["@myrepo/library"]
    }
  ]
}
```

3: Every dependency in the monorepo whose name matches `@alpha/**` should have a semver range of `~`, regardless of what the rest of the monorepo uses:

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "range": "~",
      "dependencies": ["@alpha/**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    }
  ]
}
```

4: Production dependencies should have fixed version numbers, but development and peer dependencies can be broader.

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "range": "",
      "dependencyTypes": ["prod", "resolutions", "overrides", "pnpmOverrides", "local"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    },
    {
      "range": "~",
      "dependencyTypes": ["dev"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    },
    {
      "range": "^",
      "dependencyTypes": ["peer"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    }
  ]
}
```
