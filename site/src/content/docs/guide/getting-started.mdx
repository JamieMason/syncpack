Syncpack is a command-line tool for consistent dependency versions in large JavaScript Monorepos, it is used by [AWS](https://github.com/aws/aws-pdk), [Cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare), [DataDog](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci), [Electron](https://github.com/electron/forge), [GoDaddy](https://github.com/godaddy/gasket), [LiveStore](https://github.com/livestorejs/livestore), [Lottie](https://github.com/LottieFiles/dotlottie-web), [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui), [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), [Qwik](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik), [Raycast](https://github.com/raycast/extensions), [Salesforce](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/pwa-kit), [TopTal](https://github.com/toptal/picasso), [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/vercel), [VoltAgent](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent), [WooCommerce](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce) and others.

Some of the things it can do are:

- Find and fix dependency version mismatches.
- Enforce a single version policy, or create partitions with separate policies.
- Find and bump outdated versions from the npm registry.
- Ensure some dependencies always remain pinned at a specific version.
- Ban some dependencies from being used: anywhere, or in specific places.
- Define rules for where exact or loose semver ranges should be used.
- Assign packages as the source of truth for specific dependencies' versions.
- Sort and format package.json files consistently.

## Try it

The fastest way to try syncpack is via [npx](HREF_NPX).

```bash
npx syncpack@alpha list --dependency-types prod
```

Run this command from the root directory of a monorepo and it will list every dependency installed under a [`dependencies`](HREF_DEPENDENCIES) property of a package.json file in the project.

Syncpack uses your package manager's workspace configuration to locate your package.json files, or you can target specific files using the [`source`](CONFIG_SOURCE) configuration or `--source` option.

For any given command, browse a summary of its options with `-h`

```bash
npx syncpack@alpha update -h
```

or display documentation and examples with `--help`

```bash
npx syncpack@alpha update --help
```

## Install

When setting up a project for real, install `syncpack` in [`devDependencies`](HREF_DEV_DEPENDENCIES) so that everyone working on your project uses the same version.

```bash
npm install syncpack@alpha --save-dev
```

The locally installed binary can be run using [npm exec](HREF_NPM_EXEC)

```bash
npm exec syncpack -- list
```

## Introduction

:::note
The examples below assume syncpack is installed globally. Replace `syncpack` with `npx syncpack@alpha` if you haven't installed it or `npm exec syncpack` if you have installed it locally.
:::

Let's see which dependencies we use the most.

```bash
syncpack list --dependency-types prod --sort count
```

Some of our dependencies might have [status codes](REF_STATUS_CODES) next to them, if our Terminal supports it we can command + click each error to view its documentation, or each filename to open the file.

To focus only on dependencies with errors, use `lint` instead of `list`.

```bash
syncpack lint --dependency-types prod
```

If the suggested changes look ok, we can autofix them.

```bash
syncpack fix --dependency-types prod
```

:::tip
After running `fix` or `update`, run your package manager (`npm install`, `pnpm install`, etc.) to update your lockfile.
:::

Or we could choose to only autofix one of them, for this example I've chosen `react`.

```bash
syncpack fix --dependency-types prod --dependencies react
```

All of syncpack's commands can be filtered in the same way, let's see if `react` needs updating.

```bash
syncpack update --check --dependencies react
```

Or list every dependency with `eslint` somewhere in the name.

```bash
syncpack list --dependencies '**eslint**'
```

Or every dependency published under the `@types` scope.

```bash
syncpack list --dependencies '@types/**'
```

We can find every dependency installed with an exact version number.

```bash
syncpack list --specifier-types exact
```

Or look for updates to [`devDependencies`](HREF_DEV_DEPENDENCIES) where only the patch version is newer than what we have installed.

```bash
syncpack update --check --dependency-types dev --target patch
```

And by removing the `--check` option we can write the newer versions to our files.

```bash
syncpack update --dependencies react
```

Each command supports `--help` for examples and available options.

```bash
syncpack list --help
```

## Configuration

Create a `.syncpackrc` file in your repo root to customise behaviour. See [Configuration](CONFIG_SYNCPACKRC) for all options.

## Further reading

1. Read the [`Peer Dependencies`](GUIDE_PEER_DEPENDENCIES) guide if your projects uses them, it will be important to understand them from a version consistency point of view.
1. [`Semver Groups`](CONFIG_SEMVER_GROUPS) configuration lets you ensure for example that version numbers in `devDependencies` always use `^` while `dependencies` always use `~`.
1. With [`Version Groups`](CONFIG_VERSION_GROUPS) configuration you can slice up your packages and dependencies in a lot of different ways. Each group can have different versioning policies to the rest of the repo, but are each kept internally consistent and valid according to their own rules.
