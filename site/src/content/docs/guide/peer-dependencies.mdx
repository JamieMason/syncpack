title: Peer Dependencies
description: Understand how peer dependencies differ from regular dependencies for correct version consistency
---

If any of your packages define [`peerDependencies`](HREF_PEER_DEPENDENCIES) (find out with `syncpack list --dependency-types peer`) it's really important that we understand them as they have a very different role.

[`dependencies`](HREF_DEPENDENCIES) tend to be exact (`1.2.3`) or clamped within the patch `~1.2.0` or sometimes even minor `^1.2.0` ranges. They're narrower in scope because there we are a **consumer** and we want higher confidence over knowing what we are running.

[`peerDependencies`](HREF_PEER_DEPENDENCIES) tend to be far broader in scope because in those scenarios we are a **provider** and we want our package to be suitable for as many consuming projects as possible. These versions tend to span entire majors (`^1`) and sometimes multiple majors (`>=6.0.0 <9.0.0`).

## Why this matters

Unless your project is well-organised using [Version Groups](CONFIG_VERSION_GROUPS), it is very likely that at some point you will see a version mismatch because a peer dependency is not equal to a production dependency.

Here's a common example:

1. One of the packages you develop is an ESLint Plugin and in its `peerDependencies` you define a range of `"eslint": ">=6.0.0 <9.0.0"` for the ESLint versions it is compatible with.
1. Elsewhere you have `"eslint": "8.53.0"` installed under `devDependencies` because you use ESLint to lint the monorepo.

Syncpack will report a version mismatch because ESLint is referenced twice with wildly different versions.

That we don't consider this particular mismatch to be a problem is domain knowledge about our specific project. Syncpack needs us to share with it that domain knowledge via its [Configuration file](CONFIG_SYNCPACKRC).
