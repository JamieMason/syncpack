As of May 2022 there is now a [Syncpack GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/syncpack-synchronise-monorepo-dependency-versions).

It is new and less stable than syncpack itself, but please give it a try and [give your feedback](https://github.com/JamieMason/syncpack-github-action/issues/new).
