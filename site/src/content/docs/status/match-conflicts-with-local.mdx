## When this happens

- ✓ Instance is in a [Highest Semver](VERSION_GROUP_HIGHEST_SEMVER) or [Lowest Semver](VERSION_GROUP_LOWEST_SEMVER) version group
- ✓ Instance has same [Semver Number](REF_GLOSSARY#semver-number) as the [Local Instance](REF_GLOSSARY#local-instance) in its group
- ✓ Instance matches its [With Range](SEMVER_GROUP_WITH_RANGE) semver group
- ✘ The Semver Range preferred by its [With Range](SEMVER_GROUP_WITH_RANGE) semver group will not satisfy the [Local Instance](REF_GLOSSARY#local-instance) if applied
- ? We can't know whether the incompatible range matters or not and have to ask
