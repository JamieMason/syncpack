title: NonSemverMismatch
status: fixable
description: Non-semver dependency has different version specifiers across multiple instances
---

## When this happens

- ✓ Instance is in a [Highest Semver](VERSION_GROUP_HIGHEST_SEMVER) or [Lowest Semver](VERSION_GROUP_LOWEST_SEMVER) version group
- ✘ Instance mismatches others in its group
- ✘ One or more Instances are not [Simple Semver](REF_GLOSSARY#simple-semver)
- ? We can't know what's right or what isn't
