title: PinOverridesSemverRangeMismatch
status: fixable
description: Pinned dependency version overrides semver range rules but has incorrect range format
---

## When this happens

- ✓ Instance is in a [Pinned](VERSION_GROUP_PINNED) version group
- ✓ Instance has same [Semver Number](REF_GLOSSARY#semver-number) as its pinned version group
- ✘ Instance mismatches its [With Range](SEMVER_GROUP_WITH_RANGE) semver group
- ! The semver group requires a range which is different to the pinned version
- ! Pinned version wins
