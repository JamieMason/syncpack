status: fixable

## When this happens

- ✓ Instance has same major.minor as all other instances in its group
- ✓ Instance matches its [With Range](SEMVER_GROUP_WITH_RANGE) semver group
- ! The semver group requires a range which would break [Same Minor](VERSION_GROUP_SAME_MINOR) policy
- ! Same minor policy wins
