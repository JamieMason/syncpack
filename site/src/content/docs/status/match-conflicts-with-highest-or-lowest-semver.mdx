status: conflict
description: Dependency matches semver group rules but conflicts with highest or lowest semver version policy
---

## When this happens

- ✓ Instance is in a [Highest Semver](VERSION_GROUP_HIGHEST_SEMVER) or [Lowest Semver](VERSION_GROUP_LOWEST_SEMVER) version group
- ✓ Instance has same [Semver Number](REF_GLOSSARY#semver-number) as highest/lowest semver in its group
- ✓ Instance matches its [With Range](SEMVER_GROUP_WITH_RANGE) semver group
- ✘ Range preferred by semver group will not satisfy the highest/lowest semver
- ? We can't know whether the incompatible range matters or not and have to ask
