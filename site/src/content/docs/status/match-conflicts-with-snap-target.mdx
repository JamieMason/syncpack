status: conflict
description: Dependency matches semver group rules but conflicts with snap target source package version policy

## When this happens

- ✓ Instance is in a [Snapped To](VERSION_GROUP_SNAPPED_TO) version group
- ✓ Instance has same [Semver Number](REF_GLOSSARY#semver-number) as the matching [snapTo](VERSION_GROUP_SNAPPED_TO#snapto) instance
- ✓ Instance matches its [With Range](SEMVER_GROUP_WITH_RANGE) semver group
- ✘ Range preferred by semver group will not satisfy the matching [snapTo](VERSION_GROUP_SNAPPED_TO#snapto) instance
- ? We can't know whether the incompatible range matters or not and have to ask
