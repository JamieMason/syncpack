title: Ensure AWS SDK dependencies always have the same version
---

Pin all dependencies from [@aws-sdk](HREF_AWS_SDK) so that they are always identical.

### 1. Add a pinned version group

- Match all **dependencies** whose name starts with `@aws-sdk/`.
- Mark the version as being pinned to **3.272.0** in this case.
- Add a **label** to document the decision/expectation.

```json title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["@aws-sdk/**"],
      "pinVersion": "3.272.0",
      "label": "AWS SDK Dependencies should all have the same version"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Look for mismatches

Any `@aws-sdk` packages which do not have the expected version can then be found:

```bash
syncpack list-mismatches
```

And fixed:

```bash
syncpack fix-mismatches
```
