title: How to stop an npm dependency being installed?
---

Ban a dependency from being used anywhere in your monorepo.

### 1. Add a version group

```json title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["never-gonna"],
      "isBanned": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Look for mismatches

Now when you run any syncpack command, banned dependencies will be listed:

```bash
syncpack list
```

And can be removed:

```bash
syncpack fix-mismatches
```
