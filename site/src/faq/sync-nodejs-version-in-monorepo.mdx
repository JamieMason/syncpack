title: Synchronise Node.js version in monorepo
---

Ensure [`engines.node`](HREF_ENGINES) version is identical in every package.

### 1. Add a custom type

I've chosen a name of `nodeEngine` but it can be anything you like.

```json title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "customTypes": {
    "nodeEngine": {
      "path": "engines.node",
      "strategy": "version"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Look for mismatches

Perform a one-off check for every usage of `engines.node` in your monorepo.

```bash
syncpack list --dependency-types nodeEngine
```

If the versions are not identical, they can be synchronised to all use the highest of the semver versions currently in use.

```bash
syncpack fix-mismatches --dependency-types nodeEngine
```

### 3. Track them in future

Add your new custom type to your `dependencyTypes` at the root level. It is included in the list of all possible dependency types.

```json title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "customTypes": {
    "nodeEngine": {
      "path": "engines.node",
      "strategy": "version"
    }
  },

  "dependencyTypes": [
    "dev"
    "nodeEngine"
    "peer"
    "prod"
  ]
}
```

Now when you run any syncpack command, `engines.node` will also be checked.

```bash
syncpack list
```

### 4. Relax the rules (optional)

If you don't want the Node.js version to be identical in every package but do want them all to be compatible with each other, you can use a [Same Range](VERSION_GROUP_SAME_RANGE) Version Group.

Note that you do have to list your customType in `dependencyTypes` for it to work within `versionGroups#dependencyTypes` or `semverGroups#dependencyTypes`.

```json title=".syncpackrc.json"
{
  "customTypes": {
    "nodeEngine": {
      "path": "engines.node",
      "strategy": "version"
    }
  },

  "dependencyTypes": [
    "dev"
    "nodeEngine"
    "peer"
    "prod"
  ],

  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "dependencyTypes": ["nodeEngine"],
      "policy": "sameRange"
    }
  ]
}
```
