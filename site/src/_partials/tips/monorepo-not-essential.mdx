<Aside type="tip" title="You don't have to use syncpack with a monorepo">
  If your project is split over many git repositories, you could create a .syncpackrc.json with a [source](CONFIG_SOURCE) property targeting the package.json files in each `git clone`.

Then you can use syncpack to update dependencies or look for problems.
