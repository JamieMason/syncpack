A "dependency type" refers to the path/location/nested property of package.json files where dependencies can be found.

- When set, only dependencies present in the named locations will be assigned to this group.
- If omitted, the default behaviour is to match dependencies everywhere they are found.
- Negated types are also supported, so a value of `["!dev", "!prod"]` would assign everything **except** `dependencies` and `devDependencies` to this group.

See the [Dependency Types](REF_DEPENDENCY_TYPES) guide for the list of possible values.
