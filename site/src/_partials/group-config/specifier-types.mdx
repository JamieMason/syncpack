- When set, only dependencies whose version specifier matches the given [specifier types](REF_SPECIFIER_TYPES) will be assigned to this group.
- If omitted, the default behaviour is to match all dependencies.
- Negated types are also supported, so a value of `["!latest", "!file"]` would assign everything **except** specifiers of the format `*` and `file:path/to/package.tgz` to this group.
