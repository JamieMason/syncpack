`syncpack` searches the monorepo root directory for a config file which follows its naming convention, but this can be overridden by providing a path to a specific configuration file instead.

The only requirement is that the file must have a file extension and that it is one of `.cjs`, `.cts`, `.js`, `.json`, `.mjs`, `.mts`, `.ts`, `.yaml`, or `.yml`.

<Code
  code={`syncpack ${props.command} --config ./config/syncpack.json`}
  lang="bash"
/>
