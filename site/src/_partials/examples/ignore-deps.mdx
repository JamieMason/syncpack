import Hx from '@site/components/hx.astro';

export const level = 'h1';

Ignore one or more dependencies so that syncpack does not inspect them.

<Hx level={props.level}>1. Add an ignored version group</Hx>

- Match 2 specific **packages** in the repo.
- Match only the **peerDependencies** in those packages.
- Add a **label** to document the decision/expectation.

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "label": "Nothing to see here, will fix soon",
      "packages": ["oops-moment", "workaround"],
      "dependencyTypes": ["peer"],
      "isIgnored": true
    }
  ]
}
```

With this configuration in place, syncpack will now completely ignore every dependency listed under `peerDependencies` in the two named packages `oops-moment` and `workaround` only.
