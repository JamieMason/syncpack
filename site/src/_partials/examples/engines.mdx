import Hx from '@site/components/hx.astro';

export const level = 'h1';

Add the [`engines`]({import.meta.env.HREF_ENGINES}) property of package.json files to also be inspected by syncpack.

<Hx level={props.level}>1. Add a custom type</Hx>

I've chosen a name of `engines` but it can be anything you like.

```jsonc title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "customTypes": {
    "engines": {
      // ^ this is your custom name
      "path": "engines",
      "strategy": "versionsByName",
    },
  },
}
```

<Hx level={props.level}>2. Look for mismatches</Hx>

Perform a one-off check of all versions defined under `engines` in your monorepo.

```bash
syncpack list --types engines
```

If the versions are not identical, they can be synchronised to all use the highest of the semver versions currently in use.

```bash
syncpack fix-mismatches --types engines
```

<Hx level={props.level}>3. Track them in future</Hx>

Add your new custom type to your `dependencyTypes`.

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "dependencyTypes": [
    "dev"
    "engines"
    "peer"
    "prod"
  ]
}
```

Now when you run any syncpack command, versions under `engines` will also be checked.

```bash
syncpack list
```

<Hx level={props.level}>4. Relax the rules (optional)</Hx>

If you don't want the Node.js version to be identical in every package but do want them all to be compatible with each other, you can use a [Same Range](/syncpack/config/version-groups/same-range) Version Group. This defines an exception which only applies to Node.js, leaving anything else found under `engines` unaffected.

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "dependencyTypes": [
    "dev"
    "engines"
    "peer"
    "prod"
  ],
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["node"],
      "dependencyTypes": ["engines"],
      "policy": "sameRange"
    }
  ]
}
```
