import Hx from '@site/components/hx.astro';

export const level = 'h1';

Ensure [`engines.node`]({import.meta.env.HREF_ENGINES}) version is identical in every package.

<Hx level={props.level}>1. Add a custom type</Hx>

I've chosen a name of `nodeEngine` but it can be anything you like.

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "customTypes": {
    "nodeEngine": {
      "path": "engines.node",
      "strategy": "version"
    }
  }
}
```

<Hx level={props.level}>2. Look for mismatches</Hx>

Perform a one-off check for every usage of `engines.node` in your monorepo.

```bash
syncpack list --types nodeEngine
```

If the versions are not identical, they can be synchronised to all use the highest of the semver versions currently in use.

```bash
syncpack fix-mismatches --types nodeEngine
```

<Hx level={props.level}>3. Track them in future</Hx>

Add your new custom type to your `dependencyTypes` at the root level.
It is included in the list of all possible dependency types.

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "customTypes": {
    "nodeEngine": {
      "path": "engines.node",
      "strategy": "version"
    }
  },

  "dependencyTypes": [
    "dev"
    "nodeEngine"
    "peer"
    "prod"
  ]
}
```

Now when you run any syncpack command, `engines.node` will also be checked.

```bash
syncpack list
```

<Hx level={props.level}>4. Relax the rules (optional)</Hx>

If you don't want the Node.js version to be identical in every package but do 
want them all to be compatible with each other, you can use a 
[Same Range](/syncpack/config/version-groups/same-range) Version Group.

Note that you do have to list your customType in `dependencyTypes` for it to
work within `versionGroups#dependencyTypes` or `semverGroups#dependencyTypes`.

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "customTypes": {
    "nodeEngine": {
      "path": "engines.node",
      "strategy": "version"
    }
  },
  
  "dependencyTypes": [
    "dev"
    "nodeEngine"
    "peer"
    "prod"
  ],

  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "dependencyTypes": ["nodeEngine"],
      "policy": "sameRange"
    }
  ]
}
```
