import Pills from '@site/src/components/pill';

<Pills optional />

A short name or description to be displayed in a header in syncpack's output,
above the dependencies which matched this group. If a `label` is not set, then
the order which this group appears in your config will be used instead.

```json title="Example where a label is used to give context to other Devs"
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "label": "AWS dependencies must all share the same version",
      "packages": ["**"],
      "dependencies": ["@aws-sdk/**"],
      "pinVersion": "3.272.0"
    }
  ]
}
```
