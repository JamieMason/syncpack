<Pills optional />

Can be used in combination with the [`packages`](#packages-string) and
[`dependencies`](#dependencies-string) properties to narrow further which
dependencies should belong to this version group. When set, only dependencies
present in the named locations will be considered a match for this version
group.

The possible values available by default are in the table below:

<DefaultDependencyTypes />

:::tip

If you define your own [`customTypes`](/config/custom-types), their names can
also be used in addition to those in the table above.

:::

In this example we define that all dependencies within `peerDependencies` in the
repo must use `"*"` as its version number, regardless of what versions of the
same dependencies might be used in `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.

```json title="Ensure peerDependencies always use *"
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "packages": ["**"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "dependencyTypes": ["peer"],
      "pinVersion": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Syncpack config files also support
[TypeScript IntelliSense](https://jamiemason.github.io/syncpack/config-file#typescript-intellisense).
