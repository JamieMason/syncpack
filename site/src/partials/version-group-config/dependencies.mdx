<Pills required />

An array of strings which should match the names of dependencies you've installed or otherwise
referenced in your package.json files. This is used in combination with the
[`packages`](#packages-string) property to determine which dependencies should belong to this
version group.

```json title="Example of which strings are matched against"
{
  "name": "not-here",
  "dependencies": { "HERE": "0.0.0" },
  "devDependencies": { "HERE": "0.0.0" },
  "overrides": { "HERE": "0.0.0" },
  "peerDependencies": { "HERE": "0.0.0" },
  "pnpm": { "overrides": { "HERE": "0.0.0" } },
  "resolutions": { "HERE": "0.0.0" }
}
```

The strings can any combination of exact matches or [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)
glob patterns:

```json title="Examples of valid values"
// match any dependency
["**"]

// match all dependencies with a certain scope
["@aws-sdk/**"]

// match specific dependencies by name
["react", "react-dom"]
```

:::tip

You can extend syncpack to look in more places by defining your own
[`customTypes`](/config/custom-types). If you do that, then the names of any dependencies found by
your `customTypes` can also be targeted using this field.
