- An array of strings which should match the `name` properties of your package.json files.
- If omitted, the default behaviour is to match every package.
- Negated types are also supported, so a value of `["!my-client", "!my-server"]` would assign everything **except** the packages `my-client` and `my-server` to this group.
- The strings can be any combination of exact matches or [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) glob patterns:

```json title="Examples of valid values"
// ✅ match any package name
packages: ["**"]

// ✅ match any package name with this scope
packages: ["@my-repo/**"]

// ✅ match specific packages by name
packages: ["my-server", "my-client"]

// ✅ match all packages except negated ones
packages: ["!my-server", "!@my-repo/**]

// ❌ no mixing of specific and negated packages
packages: ["my-client", "!@my-repo/**"]

// ❌ not file system paths, name properties of package.json files
packages: ["packages/my-client"]

// ❌ not file system globs, name properties of package.json files
packages: ["packages/**"]
```

```json title="Where this pattern is matched against"
{
  "name": "HERE",
  "version": "1.0.2"
}
```
