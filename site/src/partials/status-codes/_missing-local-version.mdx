This dependency is a package developed in your monorepo and the `local` [dependencyType](/config/dependency-types) is enabled. The `version` property of its package.json file is missing, so the correct version to be used by all instances can not be determined.

Syncpack can't know what to do and this will need to be manually resolved.
