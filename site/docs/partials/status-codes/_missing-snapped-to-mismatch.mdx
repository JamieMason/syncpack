This instance was matched by a <Link to='/config/version-groups/snapped-to'>Snapped To</Link> Version Group, the version it should use is the one set in the packages named in the `snapTo` array of this Version Group â€“ but none of those packages depend on this dependency.

Syncpack can't know what to do and this will need to be manually resolved.
