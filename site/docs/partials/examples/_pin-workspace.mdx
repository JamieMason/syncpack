export const level = 'h1';

Add a <Link to="/config/version-groups/pinned">Pinned Version Group</Link> so that local packages are always installed using `workspace:*` when they are used in `devDependencies`.

- An optional **label** can be added to document the rule.
- The **dependencies** array defines the names of the dependencies we want to target.
- **dependencyTypes** results in these dependencies only being targeted by this group when they are located in `devDependencies`.
- **pinVersion** states that these dependencies must always use `workspace:*`.

```json title=".syncpackrc"
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "label": "Use workspace protocol when developing local packages",
      "dependencies": ["@your-repo/node-client-plugin-retry", "@your-repo/node-client", "dashboard-ui"],
      "dependencyTypes": ["dev"],
      "pinVersion": "workspace:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

:::tip

The above example can be shortened: The `$LOCAL` keyword is a helper to avoid writing out the names of every local package.

```diff
"dependencies": [
+  "$LOCAL"
-  "@your-repo/node-client-plugin-retry",
-  "@your-repo/node-client",
-  "dashboard-ui"
],
```
