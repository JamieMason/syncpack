Override your [`dependencyTypes`](../config/dependency-types.mdx) configuration
on an ad hoc basis.

This can be used to work with every package in your monorepo, but only with a
given property each time.

In this example we set all versions to use exact semver ranges in
`dependencies`, then loose ranges within `devDependencies` and
`peerDependencies` â€“ across all of your packages:

```
syncpack set-semver-ranges --types prod --semver-range ""
syncpack set-semver-ranges --types dev,peer --semver-range "^"
```

:::tip

Running syncpack multiple times with different options to target different parts
of your package.json files is a lot of work to maintain, so
[`semverGroups`](../config/semver-groups.mdx) exist to make this easier.

The above example would would defined like so:

```json
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "range": "",
      "dependencyTypes": ["prod"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    },
    {
      "range": "^",
      "dependencyTypes": ["dev", "peer"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    }
  ]
}
```

With this configuration in place, you only need to run syncpack once:

```
syncpack set-semver-ranges
```

You can verify your project is correct in CI via:

```
syncpack lint-semver-ranges
```
