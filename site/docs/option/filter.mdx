# `--filter` string

<Pills optional />

A string which will be passed to `new RegExp()` to match against package names that should be
included. This is useful alongside [`syncpack list`](../list.mdx) to check the status of a subset of
dependencies throughout your monorepo.

```
syncpack list --filter react
```
