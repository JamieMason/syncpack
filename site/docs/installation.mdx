Syncpack is a [Command Line Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application) run from
your Terminal.

## Global Install

Installing syncpack globally on your system let's you easily use it on any of the projects on your
machine:

## Project Install

Adding syncpack to your project as a dev dependency ensures that everyone on your team will use the
same version.
