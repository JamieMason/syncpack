# `versionGroups` object[]

Version groups are an array of objects which partition your monorepo into isolated sections which
each have their own rules/policy/strategy for how versions should be managed.

There are 6 types of version groups:

- [Banned](./version-groups/banned.mdx)
- [Ignored](./version-groups/ignored.mdx)
- [Pinned](./version-groups/pinned.mdx)
- [Same Range](./version-groups/same-range.mdx)
- [Snapped To](./version-groups/snapped-to.mdx)
- [Standard](./version-groups/standard.mdx)

## Example

- Let's say your monorepo directly depends on `react`, 3 of your packages have it under
  `dependencies` and another 2 have it under `peerDependencies`. Each of those 5 specific places
  where `react` is depended on we refer to as an "instance".
- Every instance of every dependency in your repo is assigned to the first version group it matches.
- Each instance can only belong to one version group.
- If you do not define any version groups, or a given instance of a dependency does not match any of
  them, it is assigned to an internal catch-all [Standard](./version-groups/standard.mdx) version
  group.

Here is an example which uses every kind of version group:

```json
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      // Pinned
      "label": "Ensure AWS SDK dependencies always use the same version",
      "packages": ["**"],
      "dependencies": ["@aws-sdk/**"],
      "pinVersion": "3.272.0"
    },
    {
      // Banned
      "label": "Please use lodash instead of underscore",
      "packages": ["**"],
      "dependencies": ["underscore"],
      "isBanned": true
    },
    {
      // Ignored
      "label": "Ignore issues in these dodgy packages",
      "packages": ["oops-moment", "workaround"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "isIgnored": true
    },
    {
      // Snapped
      "label": "Ensure all packages use whatever version the mobile-core package is using",
      "dependencies": ["react", "react-native"],
      "packages": ["**"],
      "snapTo": ["mobile-core"]
    },
    {
      // Pinned
      "label": "Use '*' under 'peerDependencies' everywhere",
      "packages": ["**"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "dependencyTypes": ["peer"],
      "pinVersion": "*"
    },
    {
      // Standard
      "label": "Resolve mismatches here with the oldest version instead of the newest",
      "dependencies": ["@vintage/**"],
      "packages": ["**"],
      "preferVersion": "lowestSemver"
    }
  ]
}
```
