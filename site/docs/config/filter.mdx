import Pills from '@site/src/components/pill';

# `filter` string[]

<Pills optional />

A string which will be passed to `new RegExp()` to match against package names
that should be included.

:::danger

`filter` was originally intended as a convenience to be used from the command
line to filter the output of `syncpack list`, **it is not recommended to add
this to your config file to manage your project more generally**.

Instead use [`versionGroups`](./version-groups.mdx) and/or
[`semverGroups`](./semver-groups.mdx).
