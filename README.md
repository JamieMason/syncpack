## üå© Installation

```bash
npm install --global syncpack
```

## ü§ñ GitHub Action

As of May 2022 there is now a
[Syncpack GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/syncpack-synchronise-monorepo-dependency-versions).
It is new and less stable than syncpack itself, but please give it a try and
[give your feedback](https://github.com/JamieMason/syncpack-github-action/issues/new).

## üìù Commands

### fix-mismatches

Ensure that multiple packages requiring the same dependency define the same
version, so that every package requires eg. `react@16.4.2`, instead of a
combination of `react@16.4.2`, `react@0.15.9`, and `react@16.0.0`.

See [`versionGroups`](#versiongroups) if you have advanced requirements.

## üõ† Configuration File

Creating a configuration file is optional, syncpack will search up the directory
tree in the following places:

- a `syncpack` property in `package.json`
- a `.syncpackrc` file in JSON or YAML format
- a `.syncpackrc.json`, `.syncpackrc.yaml`, `.syncpackrc.yml`, `.syncpackrc.js`,
  or `.syncpackrc.cjs` file
- a `syncpack.config.js` or `syncpack.config.cjs` CommonJS module exporting an
  object

If you want to specify a path to a configuration file, overriding the discovered
configuration file (if present), you can use the `--config` option.

### Default Configuration

```json
{
  "dev": true,
  "filter": ".",
  "indent": "  ",
  "overrides": true,
  "peer": true,
  "pnpmOverrides": true,
  "prod": true,
  "resolutions": true,
  "workspace": true,
  "semverGroups": [],
  "semverRange": "",
  "sortAz": [
    "contributors",
    "dependencies",
    "devDependencies",
    "keywords",
    "peerDependencies",
    "resolutions",
    "scripts"
  ],
  "sortFirst": ["name", "description", "version", "author"],
  "source": [],
  "versionGroups": []
}
```

### `dev`, `peer`, `prod`, `resolutions`, `overrides`, `pnpmOverrides`, and `workspace`

Whether to search within `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, `dependencies`,
`resolutions` (Yarn), `overrides` (npm), `pnpmOverrides` (pnpm), and the
`version` property of the package.json files of your own packages developed
within your `workspace` respectively.

All of these locations are searched by default but they can be disabled
individually in your config file. If any are set via the command line options
`--dev`, `--peer`, `--prod`, `--resolutions`, `--overrides`, `--pnpmOverrides`,
or `--workspace` then only the options you provide will be searched.

### `filter`

A string which will be passed to `new RegExp()` to match against package names
that should be included.

### `indent`

The character(s) to be used to indent your package.json files when writing to
disk.

### `semverRange`

Defaulted to `""` to ensure that exact dependency versions are used instead of
loose ranges, but this can be overridden in your config file or via the
`--semver-range` command line option.

#### Supported Ranges

```
<  <1.4.2
<= <=1.4.2
"" 1.4.2
~  ~1.4.2
^  ^1.4.2
>= >=1.4.2
>  >1.4.2
*  *
```

### `sortAz`

When using the `format` command, determines which fields within package.json
files should be sorted alphabetically. When the value is an Object, its keys are
sorted alphabetically. When the value is an Array, its values are sorted
alphabetically. There is no equivalent CLI Option for this configuration.

### `sortFirst`

When using the `format` command, determines which fields within package.json
files should appear at the top, and in what order. There is no equivalent CLI
Option for this configuration.

### `source`

Defaults to `["package.json", "packages/*/package.json"]` to match most Projects
using Lerna or Yarn Workspaces, but this can be overridden in your config file
or via multiple `--source` command line options. Supports any patterns supported
by [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob).

### `versionGroups`

The most common use case for version groups is when some of the packages in your
Monorepo are considered alpha (or legacy). Since those packages are much further
ahead (or behind) the other packages, the dependencies within those packages
need to be managed differently to the rest of the Monorepo.

Your alpha packages might use unstable versions of some dependencies, while the
rest of the repo might need to remain on stable versions.

You don't want mismatches within your alpha packages, you don't want mismatches
within the other packages, but you _do_ want those groups to use different
versions _to each other_ and not have `syncpack` make them all the same.

In the following example, 2 of our packages are using different versions of
`react` and `react-dom` to the rest of the project.

```json
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["react", "react-dom"],
      "packages": ["@alpha/server", "@alpha/ui"]
    }
  ]
}
```

> üëã The `dependencies` and `packages` fields are processed using
> [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch), so the above example can
> also be written as `"packages": ["@alpha/**"]`.

`syncpack` will make ensure that:

- The versions of `react` and `react-dom` are the same within `@alpha/server`
  and `@alpha/ui`.
- The versions of `react` and `react-dom` are the same across every package
  except `@alpha/server` and `@alpha/ui`.
- The versions of `react` and `react-dom` within `@alpha/server` and `@alpha/ui`
  can be different to the other packages in the monorepo.
- The versions of every other dependency in the monorepo (eg `lodash`) are the
  same across every package including `@alpha/server` and `@alpha/ui`.

Each dependency can only belong to one version group, the first rule which
matches a given dependency and package will apply.

You can be quite granular with these rules, so the partitioning doesn't _have_
to apply to an entire package:

- A specific dependency in a specific package.
- A specific dependency in some specific packages only.
- Any dependency who name matches a pattern such as `@aws-sdk/**`.

See [`semverGroups`](#semverGroups) for more examples, they work the same way.

#### `versionGroup.dependencies`

Required. An array of minimatch glob patterns which should match the key of
dependencies defined in your package.json files.

| Pattern                  | Matches                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `["**"]`                 | Any dependency                           |
| `["@aws-sdk/**"]`        | Any dependency with the scope `@aws-sdk` |
| `["react", "react-dom"]` | Specific dependencies by name            |

#### `versionGroup.packages`

Required. An array of minimatch glob patterns which should match the `name`
property of packages developed within your monorepo.

| Pattern                      | Matches                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `["**"]`                     | Any package                           |
| `["@my-repo/**"]`            | Any package with the scope `@my-repo` |
| `["my-server", "my-client"]` | Specific packages by name             |

#### `versionGroup.dependencyTypes`

Optional. If set, will result in only the dependency types included in that
array being considered a match for this version group.

In this example we define that all dependencies within `peerDependencies` in the
repo must match, regardless of what versions of the same dependencies might be
used in `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.

```json
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "dependencyTypes": ["peerDependencies"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `versionGroup.isBanned`

Remove dependencies which you've decided should never be allowed.

```json
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["never-gonna"],
      "isBanned": true,
      "packages": ["**"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `versionGroup.pinVersion`

Pin the version of all dependencies in this group to match this specific version
you've defined.

```json
{
  "versionGroups": [
    {
      "dependencies": ["@aws-sdk/**"],
      "packages": ["**"],
      "pinVersion": "3.55.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `semverGroups`

Allow some packages to have different semver range rules to the rest of your
monorepo. Each dependency can only belong to one semver group, the first rule
which matches a given dependency and package will apply.

#### Example use cases

1: Every dependency of `@myrepo/library` should have a semver range of `~`,
regardless of what the rest of the monorepo uses:

```json
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "range": "~",
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["@myrepo/library"]
    }
  ]
}
```

2: Every dependency of `@myrepo/library` whose name matches `@alpha/**` should
have a semver range of `^`, regardless of what the rest of that package or the
rest of the monorepo uses:

```json
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "range": "^",
      "dependencies": ["@alpha/**"],
      "packages": ["@myrepo/library"]
    }
  ]
}
```

3: Every dependency in the monorepo whose name matches `@alpha/**` should have a
semver range of `~`, regardless of what the rest of the monorepo uses:

```json
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "range": "~",
      "dependencies": ["@alpha/**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    }
  ]
}
```

3: Production dependencies should have fixed version numbers, but development
and peer dependencies can be broader.

```json
{
  "semverGroups": [
    {
      "range": "",
      "dependencyTypes": [
        "prod",
        "resolutions",
        "overrides",
        "pnpmOverrides",
        "workspace"
      ],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    },
    {
      "range": "~",
      "dependencyTypes": ["dev"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    },
    {
      "range": "^",
      "dependencyTypes": ["peer"],
      "dependencies": ["**"],
      "packages": ["**"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `semverGroup.range`

Which of the [Supported Ranges](#supported-ranges) this group should use.

#### `semverGroup.dependencies`

Works the same as [`semverGroup.dependencies`](#semvergroupdependencies).

#### `semverGroup.packages`

Works the same as [`semverGroup.packages`](#semvergrouppackages).

#### `semverGroup.dependencyTypes`

Works the same as [`semverGroup.dependencyTypes`](#semvergroupdependencytypes).

## üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Resolving Packages

package.json files are resolved in this order of precendence:

1.  If `--source`
    [glob patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) are
    provided, use those.
2.  If using [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/),
    read `workspaces` from `./package.json`.
3.  If using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/), read `packages` from
    `./lerna.json`.
4.  If using [Pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/), read `packages` from
    `./pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
5.  Default to `'package.json'` and `'packages/*/package.json'`.

> üëã Always add quotes around your `--source` patterns [[more info](https://github.com/JamieMason/syncpack/issues/66#issuecomment-1146011769)].
