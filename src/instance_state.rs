//! # Instance State Machine
//!
//! This module defines the state machine for dependency instances. Every
//! instance (e.g., "react@18.0.0 in package-a's dependencies") goes through
//! validation and is assigned one of these states.
//!
//! ## State Hierarchy
//!
//! ```text
//! InstanceState
//! ├── Unknown          - Initial state, not yet inspected
//! ├── Valid            - Follows all rules correctly (14 variants)
//! ├── Invalid          - Breaks rules (subdivided into 3 categories)
//! │   ├── Fixable      - Can auto-fix, we know the correct value (8 variants)
//! │   ├── Unfixable    - Ambiguous, need human decision (3 variants)
//! │   └── Conflict     - Conflicting rules between groups (2 variants)
//! └── Suspect          - Misconfiguration detected (5 variants)
//! ```
//!
//! ## When States Are Assigned
//!
//! States are assigned during the **Inspect Phase** in `visit_packages()`,
//! never during Context creation. This is a critical invariant.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Phase 1: Create (states are Unknown)
//! let ctx = Context::create(config, packages, registry_client);
//!
//! // Phase 2: Inspect (states are assigned here)
//! let ctx = visit_packages(ctx);
//!
//! // Phase 3: Commands process based on states
//! lint::run(ctx);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Choosing the Right State
//!
//! ### Valid
//! Use when the instance follows all rules correctly:
//! - `IsLocalAndValid` - Local package with valid version
//! - `IsPinned` - Matches pinned version
//! - `IsHighestOrLowestSemver` - Correct per version group policy
//!
//! ### Invalid::Fixable
//! Use when we know the correct value and can auto-fix:
//! - `IsBanned` - Should be removed
//! - `DiffersToLocal` - Should match local package
//! - `DiffersToPinnedVersion` - Should use pinned version
//!
//! ### Invalid::Unfixable
//! Use when the situation is ambiguous:
//! - `NonSemverMismatch` - Multiple non-semver versions, can't pick one
//! - `DependsOnInvalidLocalPackage` - Local package itself is invalid
//!
//! ### Invalid::Conflict
//! Use when version group and semver group rules conflict:
//! - `MatchConflictsWithHighestOrLowestSemver` - Range can't satisfy version
//!
//! ### Suspect
//! Use when user has misconfigured something:
//! - `RefuseToBanLocal` - Can't ban local package (invalid config)
//! - `RefuseToPinLocal` - Can't pin local package (invalid config)
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // In a visitor function
//! if instance.version != expected_version {
//!     *instance.state.borrow_mut() = InstanceState::fixable(DiffersToPinnedVersion);
//! } else {
//!     *instance.state.borrow_mut() = InstanceState::valid(IsPinned);
//! }
//!
//! // In a command
//! dependency.get_sorted_instances()
//!     .filter(|instance| instance.is_fixable())
//!     .for_each(|instance| {
//!         // Auto-fix this instance
//!     });
//! ```
